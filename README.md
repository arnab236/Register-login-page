# Register-login-page

As a beginner,this is my first code....

This is a basic login-register page  for beginners.

HTMl here used for the structure of two pages.

CSS is added for the design of it and make both pages interchangeable through hoover effect.

Javascript can help to tell that there is empty space or for error message show.
